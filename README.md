This is the recipes website project that will test my knowledge in html.

I will have to buil a website based only in html to show what I have learned in this chapter: html structure, DOCTYPE, head, body, meta, title, h1, p, ul, ol, li, a, href, img, src, etc

I will also have to use my abilities with the terminal command, and git, github.
