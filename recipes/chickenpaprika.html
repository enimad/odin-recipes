    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The great blend of spices on these broiled chicken breasts has a wonderful flavor and pairs well with many vegetable side dishes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 and 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, chopped</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Grease a broiler pan with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Brush with remaining olive oil until coated. Sprinkle each piece evenly on both sides with paprika, lemon-pepper, and salt. Place on the prepared broiler pan, sprinkle garlic over top, and sprinkle onions around the base of the chicken, with several smaller pieces on top.</li>
            <li>Cook under the preheated broiler for 5 minutes. Flip and continue to cook, checking often, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
